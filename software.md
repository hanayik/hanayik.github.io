Label anatomical landmarks in MNI space, then translate them to an individual subject's brain (roughly). The landmarks in subject space will need to be fine tuned, but this is a much faster process compared to labeling the landmarks from scratch for each subject. 

## Cogniton/Perception
### [Simultaneous Tempoal Perception] (https://github.com/hanayik/Simultaneous-Temporal-Perception)

In everyday life, we often make judgments regarding the sequence of events, for example deciding whether a baseball runnerâ€™s foot hit the plate before or after the ball hit the glove. This software experiment was designed to test participants' temporal perception abilities while undergoing fMRI scanning.


### [Flicker Fusion](https://github.com/hanayik/FlickerFusion)

This software is designed to find the fusion threshold between any two colors (e.g. match the brightness values of of two colors). Useful for visual perception experiments.

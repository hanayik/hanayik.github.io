# Bio

As a student and a professional, I have trained under some of the world leaders in neuroimaging and stroke recovery research. Throughout my training I have gained great respect for the complexity of the human brain, and the intricacies involved in studying it. Through a combination of structured and autodidactic learning I have developed many skills crucial to understanding the brain in both healthy and neurologically impaired individuals. Relevant skills include MRI acquisition and analysis, extensive programming in multiple computer languages, and development of neuropsychological assessment material. I am also an expert in computer based experiment creation using popular software packages such as Psychtoolbox and PsychoPy. Together, my technical expertise and training as a psychologist enable me to seek out answers to complex neuropsychological questions in new and creative ways. My ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of perceptual processes in the human brain, and how it recovers after injuries such as stroke.
